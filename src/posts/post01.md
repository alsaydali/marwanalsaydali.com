<p class=" font-bold pb-3"> Hello World</p>

<p class="pb-3">
My name is Marwan Alsaydali, I am a Father, Husband, Web developer, and Photographer!</p>
<p class="pb-3">
COVID-19 is here and our life flipped upside down, new normal and a lot of habits had been changed. Like a lot of people around the world, I had to be part of slowing the spreading of this pandemic, I stayed home for a while, so I thought to rebuild my website, and add a blog to it so I can determine what I learn and what I do.</p>
<p class="pb-3">
The plan is to keep adding to this website and blog what I learn and what I add to my skills as a web developer, I am planning to keep at least one blog post to summarise what I learned in that month or maybe more for smaller tips or news.</p>
<p class="pb-3">
Thank you so much for reaching out, please feel free to contact me directly for any farther questions about working together or even for chat and coffee minding social distancing.</p>

Marwan Alsaydali.
